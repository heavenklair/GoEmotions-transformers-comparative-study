# Comparative Study of Transformers Models in Understanding Emotions

## Abstract
This paper delves into the nuanced task of emo- tion classification in online communication, fo- cusing on analyzing Reddit posts. The core ob- jective is to accurately categorize each post into one of 28 distinct categories: 27 specific emo- tions or a Neutral state. This endeavor lever- ages a rich dataset of approximately 43,000 instances, marking a significant intersection be- tween Natural Language Processing (NLP) and emotional analysis in digital interactions. This project explored the use of transformer models, chosen for their proven efficacy in capturing the subtle complexities and contextual nuances inherent in textual emotional expression.
